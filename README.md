## Introduction

The **2048-Deep-Q-Bot** project implements a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning to play the game 2048. The objective of the bot is to learn an optimal strategy to reach the 2048 tile in the least number of moves. The game logic is implemented in Python, and the neural network is built using TensorFlow.

## Features

- Fully functional 2048 game logic
- Deep Q-Learning agent
- Model saving and loading for continued training
- Training progress and timing information

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-Deep-Q-Bot.git
    cd 2048-Deep-Q-Bot
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train the Deep Q-Learning agent, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```
